# JukeBerryPi

A "crowdsourced" JukeBox application installed on a Raspberry Pi,
wherein guests can connect to the app using their mobile devices and then search for and add songs, 
like and dislike songs on the main playlist,  as well as post pictures on the app's main page. 
It is pretty useful on bars, parties, social  events and other gatherings wherein guests can contribute 
to the music being currently played.
